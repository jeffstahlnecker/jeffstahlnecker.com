I have accepted a challenge to get back on track. Tomorrow I will be spending 5 hours working on my novel. The goal is to finish revising my current work and begin starting something fresh. I've made some pretty solid progress, so I believe that this goal will be met.

In addition to my goal tomorrow, this week I will be finishing the book "Writing the Breakout Novel" by Donald Maass. It has been a fun and educational book to read, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the art of writing.

Next week I will focus on writing the new content that I have outlined for the book. This will likely last quite a few weeks.

The most important point to take from this post, ladies and gentlemen --Â I'm back in business.
