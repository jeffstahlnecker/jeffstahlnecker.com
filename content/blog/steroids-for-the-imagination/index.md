When I read a good book I don't feel like I'm reading a book. I feel like I'm living in a new world. The environment comes alive, I can smell the trees, I can see the green leaves, and I live through the character. Books for me are like imagination steroids. So when I write a book, it is extremely important that I write about something I truly know.

I recently wrote a scene in which one of my characters was injured. It felt wrong. Empty. Something wasn't in place. So to clear my mind I went for a run and early the next morning the solution hit me. My character didn't act like he was in pain. I started taking notes and rewrote the scene.

This experience reminded me how important it is to research or find a way to experience every small detail that you write. When you understand it fully, then the details in your book will be like steroids for someone's imagination.

On a side note, if your character suffers from severe burns, I am in no way suggesting that you severely burn yourself so that you can write a better scene. That is a topic for research.
