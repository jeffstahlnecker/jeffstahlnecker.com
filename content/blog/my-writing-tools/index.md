With what do you write?

I like to write with a pen and paper. That's right, I'm old-fashioned.

Working with a pen and paper helps me feel closer to what I'm writing. It gives me a higher level of satisfaction - as if I'm accomplishing something more than if I type it out on my computer.

I am rather picky about what I write on. I use a Moleskine notebook. I like how the hardbound ruled book holds itself together with the elastic strap, and how it has a space in the back for me to put the bits of paper that accumulate as I write random notes throughout the day. The Moleskine notebook helps me keep everything together in one package.

I also use a Rite in the Rain All-Weather pen. It says that it will write anywhere. So far it has, and that keeps me using it.

_I did not receive anything from Moleskine or Rite in the Rain._
