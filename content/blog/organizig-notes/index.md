It seems that I have developed a large stack of notes. They range from notes on Greek mythology, to character histories, to different aspects of various scenes in the world that I am developing. Now that I look back and see it all, I ask myself, how do I put it all together? It feels like a daunting task.

My first problem, is my lack of preliminary organization. I have notes, often written on scraps of paper or in the pages of my notebook, and I tagged them in a corner of the page with the subject, but they have not been put into any form of overall organization. So I'm going to try something new.

This week I will be transferring the bulk of my notes to a program called Evernote. This allows me to search through my notes based on the tags I use in them. Which, hopefully, will help me use my notes and research more effectively.

How do you organize your notes?
