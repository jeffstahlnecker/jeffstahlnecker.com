So. I have a dilemna. I enjoy writing the history of my characters. It helps me get to know them better, understand why they do what they do and provides me with further insight as to how they will react to certain events and moments. I originally wrote the backstory as part of my novel and I've become rather attached to it. Every time I read through it I get goosebumps! Unfortunately having so much backstory may provide too much information and may remove the "mystery" that lies behind my progagonist.

By removing the backstory of my character, I provide myself with an arsenal of information I can use in later dialogue without becoming redundant. It also keeps the reader asking why my protaganist chose to do this or that, thereby allowing them to get to know my character at the same pace as the other characters in the book. I find this to be an exceptional method with which to bridge conflict and keep the reader reading.

On the other side of the coin, the dialogue in that section is good. I hope I'm not being vain in saying this, but I honestly believe it. It's engaging, has a hint of humor and reads smoothly. It provides the book with a strong start, and gives the reader with some insight into the history of the world I have created and the earlier personalities of the people that play a major role in the story. It's a difficult decision.

What are your thoughts?
