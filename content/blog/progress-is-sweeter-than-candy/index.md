There were several days this week that ended with a smile. I broke through a phase of inactivity and uncertainty and finally made some progress.

Have you ever written dialogue, a conversation between characters, that leaves you staring at the computer screen, page, or however you choose to write, thinking "wow, I just wrote that?" It's a lovely feeling, and a feeling that tends to make me want to write more often, and reminds me why I enjoy writing so much.

Now that things are moving along again, I find myself spending more time writing my book than I do reading other books.

I would like to thank [A.M.B](http://misfortuneofknowing.wordpress.com) and [geminye](http://birthofawriter.wordpress.com) for the great advice they left for me in the comments of my last post. They both have great blogs that are definitely worth following.
