Yes! That's right, I was able to meet the writing challenge and finish the revisions on the completed portions of the book. And now, it's time for something new.

I enjoy writing new content more than revising the older stuff. It's always a new adventure with surprising turns of events, unexpected character development that suddenly makes sense, and even the occasional intelligent or comical phrase that leaves me thinking that my characters are funnier or more intelligent than I am.

My progress reading "Writing the Breakout Novel" by Donald Maass has not been as impressive. But the week is yet to be over and I hope to update you tomorrow with the success of this goal. Next week I will also post a short review of the book for those interested in learning more about writing a book or short story and getting it published.
