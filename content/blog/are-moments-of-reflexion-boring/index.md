Picture this. You have a character that's suddenly thrown into a nest of crazy, insane, and simply impossible circumstances that forces the character to grow, change and develop. How do you write the characters thoughts and feelings losing the necessary tension to keep readers reading?

In the book "Ender's Shadow," by Orson Scott Card, a character named "Bean" undergoes radical development. Throughout the book Bean's thoughts are written plainly for you to see. There are even moments in which Bean simply thinks about how he's feeling about things, or will react to something, or even better - thoughts that lead to an important discovery.

What Card does though, is he often writes these moments as Bean is doing something else. Either he's walking through an alley, searching for an advantage, or even once - waking up from a bad dream. When Bean contemplates something and how he will react to something, he is often doing something either related, or completely unrelated. But there is still a sense of action in the scene.

I believe that scenes of reflexion aren't always boring, though they can be extremely boring if the character is simply repeating what the reader already knows. What do you think though? Do you find moments of character reflexion dull? Leave me a comment, give some examples, lets talk about it.
