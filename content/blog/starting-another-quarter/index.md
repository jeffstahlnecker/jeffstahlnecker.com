One thing I think is absolutely brilliant, is how Starbucks made me a customer. I don't particularly like their brewed coffee, I believe that many times they are slightly over-priced, but they offer members of the Booster Club at WWU a free drink every time they buy one. So... I often find myself here when I meet with a group for homework, want to find somewhere different to study, or simply have a craving for some tea or coffee and can't imagine _not_ getting two drinks for my $2. Pathetically,I find myself sitting here during vacation and writing my first post sipping a brewed chai tea with steamed soy and a salted caramel mocha.

I'm curious though, where do you like to drink coffee or tea, or whatever your favorite hot beverage is, and what do you like to drink?
