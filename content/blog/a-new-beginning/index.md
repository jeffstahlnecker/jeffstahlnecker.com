My book now has a new beginning, and I'm excited about it. I've added an entirely new element and dimension to the book. I have developed a new character, and created large amount of history for my protagonist. I really like it, but I might not use it.

I feel like it gives too much information too quickly. It is a great resource for me to get content for conversations, but the entire back-story written at the beginning of the novel feels like it could be better placed somewhere else.

In his book "Writing the Breakout Novel," Maas notes that authors can write content that they don't always use but inherently helps to build a better book. I believe that the back-story of my protagonist that I wrote is important, but the information would be better placed elsewhere in the novel.

Should every bit of writing be held as is, or do you believe that there are portions of a novel that readers never read, portions used as resources written by the author, only for the author? What do you think?
