Greetings!  I would like to invite you to join me on an adventure. A spectacular, exciting, interactive adventure of a neophyte author hoping to get a book published within the span of his life. This adventure will contain climaxes of exciting developments, new ideas, and superb advice from you, my friends, colleagues, and commenters. It will also likely contain the mellow lows of tragic writer's block, returned manuscripts, and dwindling motivation. The author is me, and my name is Jeff.

I am working on a fantasy novel.  I started it a number of years ago, and as I have grown and developed, so has it. The book has, however, always remained in the background of my life, and has stalled in development.

Throughout this summer I plan outlining the remainder of the book, rewriting portions of it that have already been written, doing research, and finishing the large amount that still needs to be written.

Through all of this, I would like to hear about your experiences in writing, and together we can build a community of aspiring writers, support each other, and maybe someday, meet and share some of our work.

_It's time to write!_
