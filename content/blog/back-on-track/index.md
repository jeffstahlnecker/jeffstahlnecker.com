Success! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, readers of all ages, I am back on track and writing again.

It's feels good to move forward again. I ended up rewriting part of the novel, but in the end my characters feel like themselves again, the plot fits, and I've even been able to reach that turning point that I was shooting for. I'm excited. In one day I've been able to accomplish quite a bit.

I am, however, slightly concerned about how fast time is traveling. It's already September and I haven't made nearly as much progress with this novel as I had hoped. Classes will be starting soon, and they will likely rip my attention away from my book, and throw it at things like taking the GRE, studying for tests, and doing homework.

With this said, it sounds to me like it's time for another writing challenge. Do you have one in mind? Comment and let me know.
