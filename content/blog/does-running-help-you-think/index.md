At one point in my life, I used to do a lot of running. I would run almost every day, participate in a number of 5k fun runs, and try to get people to do some trail runs with me. Over the past year I've slowed down. What I've noticed though, is often times when I run, I come up with some great ideas for my stories. This lead me to ask whether running truly helps me think.

In January, 2010, BBC reported that Cambridge scientists working with mice, discovered that a higher level of physical activity stimulates brain growth. Simply put, the more active rodents developed more new brain cells.

After reading this article, I decided to take to the streets and trails again. Truth be told, once again I was able to come up with some great ideas for my novel. Unfortunately I am unable to remember all of them.

Do you find that going running/jogging or increasing your activity helps stimulate your creative powers? If so, how do you record the ideas that you come up with? Let me know.
