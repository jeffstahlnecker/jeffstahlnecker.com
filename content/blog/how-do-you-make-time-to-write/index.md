One thing that I have difficulty with is finding time to write. I get in a habit of pushing writing to the side in favor of some other miscellaneous activity. Especially after a long day of work when I rarely have the energy to sit down and work on my book.

I am unsure whether there is a perfect way to make time to write, but the best way I can think of, is to schedule a writing time each day, and stick to it. Then, if I stick to the schedule for a week, I will splurge, buy myself some ice cream, and read what I have accomplished while enjoying that succulent dessert.

How do you make time to write?
