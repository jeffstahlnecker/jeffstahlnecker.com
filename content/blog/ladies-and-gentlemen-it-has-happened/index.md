That's right, I have writer's block. I'm at a pivotal turning point in my novel and I can't figure out how to write it. Or rather, I've written it three times and didn't like any of the three. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't build right. It's just not working. It's honestly quite frustrating.

Fortunately I have a routine for such moments. The first thing I do when I realize that things just aren't working, is stop writing. If it doesn't click then I'm just wasting my time. So I stop and find something active to do to clear my mind. Then I spend time pondering the problem. I think about who my characters are and what my story is about, and usually within a few days I come up with something perfect.

I'm curious though, what's your way of dealing with writer's block?
