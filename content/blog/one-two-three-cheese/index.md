Have you ever read a line a in a book and simply thought, "wow, that was cheesy?" Well folks I have. In fact, I'm slightly embarrassed to say this -- I wrote one.

Sometimes when I'm having trouble finding headway, I backtrack and read through what I have written so far. It was in such a moment that I came across some pretty solid cheese sitting right in the middle of a dialogue between my protagonist and another character. It was distracting, so I removed it from my main text and transferred it to my "not-used content" document.

If you are asking yourself whether I have overcome my writer's block, I would like to simply point out that the blog post you are reading is about cheesy lines, which, in itself, serves as a symbol of my ongoing struggle.

On a more positive note, I'm planning on spending a large amount of time working on my novel tomorrow. With a little luck and imagination, I may just break through.
