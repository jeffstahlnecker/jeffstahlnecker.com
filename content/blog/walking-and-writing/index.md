This morning I wanted to get some writing done, so I took my notebook and went to search for a place to write. Now, if you recall, I'm in Germany and can't simply go to a place I normally write. At 6:00 in the morning I went looking, and nothing was open. So I kept walking, and wrote as I walked.

It was difficult at first. Writing legibly while underway can be quite a challenge. But after a bit of time I felt that moving through the small forested dorf actually helped me think better. I came up withÂ  a few new ideas, and pulled together yet another possible beginning for my book, and this one, I like.

Now that I finally have a start that I am satisfied with, I really need to start revising the remainder of what I have. Summertime is slowly slipping away.

Would anybody like to challenge me with a word count of text to be written by Friday?
