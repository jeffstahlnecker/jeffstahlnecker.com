Classes start next week. Unfortunately for me, this means that my relatively empty schedule will suddenly be filled with a number of other time consuming opportunities. Some of these opportunities are essential for the future, others are there to distract or frustrate me. The difficulty is determining which of the categories the activities fit in.

At the start of every university year, I go into it thinking that this year will be different. I believe that I will stick to my printed schedule - and in doing so - be able to accomplish every little thing that I want to. Unfortunately, I always do this wrong. I plan to do something every single hour of the day, from waking to sleeping. After doing this for a few days, I start to waver from this goal which causes a building feeling a failure. This turns into the prominent though of "what's the point?" Of course, once that question is asked, my schedule falls completely apart and I would simply get by.

It took me a long time to learn it, but something key in effective time management is to schedule free time. Some of the most productive countries on this planet are successful because they provide their people with an adequate amount of vacation. In providing one's self with small daily vacations, the time you spend working becomes more productive.

With this said, I'm going to try and spend a daily hour on my novel while classes are in term. This will be difficult, but with effective time management, perhaps it will be possible.

How do you fit your hobbies into your busy schedule? Let me know, your ideas and methods could prove useful, not only to me, but everyone else who reads this blog.
