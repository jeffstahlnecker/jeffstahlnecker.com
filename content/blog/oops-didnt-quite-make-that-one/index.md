That's right, I didn't make my goal to finish reading "Writing the Breakout Novel" by Donald Maass. I don't even have a catchy excuse, such as "well Joe, I didn't finish reading because I wrote another 100 pages for my breakout novel" or even "Bobby! I didn't finish the book, but I spent the weekend discussing my book with an agent, they have an interested buyer!" Nope. None of those. Instead, I spent my time playing a game called Mexican Train with my family.

At this point I would like to say that I can get very easily distracted. I didn't spend the entire weekend playing the game of course, but there were meals here, cooking there, washing dishes, or the easiest way to get distracted is to play with my 16 month old niece. She's very cute.

The solution for me is to do a better job of setting time aside to spend on my project. Time that cannot be interrupted for anything short of a run to the emergency room.

I will have the book done by the middle of next week. My goal for this week is to write a solid 20 pages. I may be shooting too high. But if you don't shoot for the moon, you'll never reach it.
