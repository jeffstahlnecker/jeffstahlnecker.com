I've been goingÂ over my old manuscript and notes to get back "in-touch" with the world, plot and characters I previously developed. A number of things caught my attention. While there are a few moments in my book that I believe are outstanding - there is a bit of material that I now find empty or dull.

A few years ago I purchased a workbook titled "Writing the Breakout Novel" by Donald Maass. I planned to use this to help me write my book - but never got around to actually actively using it. I later learned that a book was published before the workbook, and have recently purchased it to help me develop a more comprehensive toolbox of skills to use while writing my book.

If you know of any other self-help writing books that you believe to be outstanding, shoot me a comment and let me know.
