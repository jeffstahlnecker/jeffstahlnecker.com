It appears that my writing has been put on hold for the moment. My classes, masters applications, and projects have definitely taken precedence.

Maintaining my habit to write has been a difficult thing to do. In my final year studying as an undergrad I am writing such a large number of papers that it's difficult for me to be motivated enough to pick up my pen and work on something that isn't class related.At the moment I have no solution for this.

So this message, this post, is in a way of speaking my plea for help. How do you keep writing when it feels like time itself is against you?
