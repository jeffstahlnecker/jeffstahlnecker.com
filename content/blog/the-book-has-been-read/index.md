Ladies and Gentlemen, the book has been read! I actually finished reading it a two nights ago around midnight. I found the end of the book especially interesting. Maass discussed how to get a novel published and where to start when looking for an agent. It was all quite fascinating.

I have worked further on my own book, and at this time my protagonist is fleeing for his life. How he is fleeing, and from what... well those questions can be answered at another time, or perhaps when you read the book.

One thing I find especially important for me when working on the book is to always be interested in the content I'm writing. If I find that I no longer want to write, or rather that I'm getting bored, then I'm obviously doing something wrong. If I'm bored writing it, then clearly anyoneÂ reading that book would also be bored. Moments like these, though rare, do happen. When they do, I will often go back and what was boring and add something more to the passage to raise the stakes and add more tension.
