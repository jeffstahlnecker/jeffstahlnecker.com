One thing that has made it increasingly more difficult to write is the fact that in two weeks I will be a main part of a party celebrating the marriage between myself and my fiancé. The fact that this party is in Germany made it increasingly more difficult to maintain this blog.

For this reason I believe it is time to take a couple of weeks off and concentrate more on helping my fiancé with some last minute planning.

Of course I will keep writing in my spare moments, and in a couple of weeks I will update you on my progress.

Bis dann!
