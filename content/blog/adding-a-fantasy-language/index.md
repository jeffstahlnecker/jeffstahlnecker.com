I have a problem. Honestly, I have many problems, but this one is keeping me stumped. I'm in the middle of writing a fantasy book about another world, and so far the only language being used is English. When I look back at books like Lord of the Rings, or Eragon, each have a language or a number of languages that were created for different groups of people in the book. I haven't the slightest clue how to write a language.

So what should I do? Do I make up a set of grammar rules and then make up words for different things that fit those rules, or do I simply use an "old" form of a modern language such as German. I speak some German, so this wouldn't be extremely difficult to do.

How would you create a new language for a fantasy novel?
