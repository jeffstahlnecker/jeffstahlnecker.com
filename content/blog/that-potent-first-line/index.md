_Steve stopped pacing to glare at the lean man quietly reading a book in an armchair._

_"You let them take her!" he yelled at his father._

We all know that the first few lines in a book are essential to capturing the reader. Some English teachers in my past would call it the hook. They define it as something that grabs your attention, something unexpected, something that builds tension. Donald Maass in his book "Writing the Breakout Novel" points out that a good first line builds questions in the reader's mind.

Lets look at the example that one of my high school English teachers used in a writing class:

_The boat drifted solemnly through the dark and foggy night._

Why is the boat drifting? Why is the boat important? Why is it driftingÂ solemnly? What happened?

You see what I mean.

Above I wrote the first lines to one of my stories. What did you think?
