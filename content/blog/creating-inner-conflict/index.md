Aha! It's a landmark moment in my writing process. I just realized that I haven't been including enough of a key element in my book. I forgot to put the inner conflict my protagonist experiences on paper.

When I write, I often feel as if I get caught up in the story, as if I'm playing a role in it, and merely describing what I experience. Unfortunately, I have now realized that I'm not describing enough. I miss telling why my character struggles and why his decisions are difficult for him. Simply to put, I made it feel as if he always knows what to do, and does it without telling the story behind the decision.

So now comes a point when I need to go over the content I have, and write in the inner conflict.

I'm currently traveling to Germany, so I have quite a bit of time to do it.
