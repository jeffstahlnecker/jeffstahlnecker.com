One of my favorite writing projects was centered around an Oreo.

Many years ago I entered a writing class to find a large number of Oreos sitting in a corner. For me, Oreos are a guilty pleasure. They're so tasty and irresistible that I couldn't help being excited about the class on that day.

Our instructor told us to grab a few Oreos, and return to our desks, which we willingly did. Our assignment was to describe the Oreo. Describe everything about it - what does it taste like, how does it feel, what does it look like, what does it smell like, how is it built - we were to describe everything.

So I started by examining the Oreo, I tasted it, I smelled it, felt it and wrote my view and perspective on what an Oreo truly is.

As I was eating an Oreo today, I started asking myself a different question. How would a character in my book view an Oreo? My main character would probably look upon it fondly as a memory of home, another character would probably wonder what an Oreo could possibly be.

This Oreo project, in the long run, reminded me of how important it is to see the world through your character's or narrator's eyes, and to write descriptions from their perspective.

My question to you though, is how would you describe an Oreo?
