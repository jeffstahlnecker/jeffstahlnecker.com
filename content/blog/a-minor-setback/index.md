Have you ever accidentally deleted an important file?

I have. Countless times. One would think that I would learn and hold a backup of said files, but it appears that the most recent victim of an accidental "delete" was not backed up.

Not to worry I have a large number of backups of my current manuscript, however the recently written character profiles, the ones not originally written by hand in my Moleskine notebook, are now gone.

In the process of cleansing my iPad of dated homework assignments, I went to delete a file titled "blank 1." Instead the technological device decided to resort my files at that moment, thereby deleting a file titled "character profiles." After a quick internet search, it appears that the file is not recoverable.

On the bright side, the unfortunate demise of my character profiles will allow me to rewrite them and further develop my characters.

A new system to backup my files is now in place, so future accidental deletions should be recoverable.
