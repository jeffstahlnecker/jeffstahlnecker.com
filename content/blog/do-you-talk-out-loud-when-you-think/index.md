I do. Sometimes I find myself discussing a character or a fictional event with the wall, a tree, or the small spider crawling across my wall. Somehow just hearing my ideas not only makes everything feel more real, but also helps me move on through the story or understand the character better.

Richard Alleyne, the science correspondent at the Telegraph, reported in 2009 that talking out loud helps you solve problems, math problems.

"Those who detailed their thinking process out loudÂ had more chance of answering the same question correctly as those who did not talk about their problem solving plan, the researchers found," Alleyne wrote, referring to a study led by the University of Granada, Spain.

So there you have it. When someone points out to you that you're thinking out loud, and this is a sign of insanity, don't worry. Talking out loud really does help you think.
