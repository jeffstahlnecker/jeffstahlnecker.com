It feels like I'm stuck in an endless circle. I write content, then I reread it, discover that I don't like it, cut it and put it in my "cut-outs" document. Then I edit the surrounding text, rewrite the section I cut, and start the process all over again. Progress can, at times, be hard to see.

When I first started writing I could get ten pages done in a day. I pushed forward and didn't look back until I was ready to reread and edit. I would see progress, and the story would move forward.

Now when I write, I think about how what I'm writing could fit into the big picture. I try to imagine what the characters would feel at this point or about what they are doing. I picture the way they interact with the story and each other. Then I write. And rewrite, until the scene feels right.

It takes more time, and, at times, it can be slightly depressing to spend a few hours on a book, and leave it with only an added page, or at times, a page less than when I started working on it. But in the end, when I read over what I have written, I believe that I am more satisfied with the story.

Perhaps I'm over thinking and should simply push forward again to help the story continue. What do you think?
