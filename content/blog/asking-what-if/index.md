Last night I couldn't sleep. So naturally I began thinking about my book and asking myself how the book could be developed differently.Â  I had an idea. What if I started it even further along in the story? If I made my protagonists "new life" the norm and filled in the back story through later conversations and experiences. It could work.

The book I am working on is a fantasy novel about a conflict in another world. I believe that by removing this world, the book would flow better in the new world. Many aspects could be described as normal life, versus trying to incorporate a surprise reaction every time something new appears.

I'll give it a try, put together a few pages and see how it works out. If it doesn't, I can always return to the beginning I already have.
