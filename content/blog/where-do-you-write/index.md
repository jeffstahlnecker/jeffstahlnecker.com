It was inevitable. Here I am working on my book at Starbucks. I'm not sure how to pinpoint exactly why, but the coffee shop atmosphere seems to inspire creativity. Many theories likely point to the common stimulant contained in a Starbucks cup of coffee as the source of this inspiring location, but I personally believe it to be the busy atmosphere and all the people.

Perhaps the center of inspiration dwells in the people that surround us. Maybe it lies in the teenage girl that, just ten minutes ago, apologetically proposed to me while frantically explaining that her friends made her do it. Or the woman passing by the window with flaming red hair. What better way to present a realistic fictional environment than by first observing the actions and interactions of other people?

Where do you find your inspiration? Where do you write?
