Loss of a loved one has been the turning point in a variety of novels. In Christopher Paolini's book "Eragon," it is the loss of his uncle that motivates his journey through Alagaesia. In Piers Anthony's "For Love of Evil," it is the loss of his wife and father figure that stimulates the protagonist to fight evil. He is so successful that he draws the attention of Lucifer himself. Loss is an excellent motivator for change, but I find it difficult to write.

It is the question of balance that stumps me. I'm finding it difficult write so that a character grieves convincingly without overwhelming the reader with the tragedy of his situation and distracting from his current progress. I believe the key to this is finding a better way to integrate his grief with the daily progress of the story through small elements that remind him of his loss. I still cannot decide if that's too much.

In Piers Anthony's book he keeps the dead wife as a ghost that can interact with the main character. She's still there, but it isn't the same, and he still grieves. This solution works as it phases her out some before she's gone entirely. I can't remember many moments of significance that Eragon grieves for his uncle and I find that unrealistic. Like many I have felt loss and though I attempt to hide my grief behind my work, it's still in my thoughts, heart and mind.

If you have any examples you can provide of well written grief or loss, please share those with me. I look forward to reading them.
